# Weather Prediction Project
---
AWS and PySpark mllib introductory exploration project ingesting weather data from the OpenMeteo API that was migrated to Azure.
The purpose of this project was to explore AWS through Glue, S3, and Athena before migrating the project to an Azure environment.
The Jupyter notebooks stored here have been translated for usage in Azure Databricks but can be ran in an AWS Glue environment with minimal edits.
